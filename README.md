# EditorConfig Emacs Plugin

This is an [EditorConfig][] plugin for [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

## Installation

Download the [EditorConfig C Core][] and follow the instructions in the README
and INSTALL files to install it.

This plugin also has a core library implemented in Emacs-Lisp, and fallback
to it when no core executable is found.

In either case, copy `.el` files in this repository to `~/.emacs.d/lisp`
and add the following to your `~/.emacs` file:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
(require 'editorconfig)
(editorconfig-mode 1)
```

Alternatively, you can find the package available on
[MELPA](http://melpa.org/#/editorconfig) and [MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org/#/editorconfig)
([The Marmalade package](http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/editorconfig) is deprecated).

Or if you use [**use-package**](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UsePackage):

```emacs-lisp
(use-package editorconfig
  :ensure t
  :config
  (editorconfig-mode 1))
```

## Supported properties

Current Emacs plugin coverage for EditorConfig's [properties][]:

* `indent_style`
* `indent_size`
* `tab_width`
* `end_of_line`
* `charset`
* `trim_trailing_whitespace`
* `insert_final_newline = true` is supported
* <del>`insert_final_newline = false`</del> is not enforced
  (as in trailing newlines actually being removed automagically),
  we just buffer-locally override any preferences that would auto-add them
  to files `.editorconfig` marks as trailing-newline-free
* `max_line_length`
* `root` (only used by EditorConfig core)

Not yet covered properties marked with <del>over-strike</del>
â€“ pull requests implementing missing features warmly welcomed!
Typically, you will want to tie these to native functionality,
or the configuration of existing packages handling the feature.

As several packages have their own handling of, say, indention,
we might not yet cover some mode you use, but we try to add the
ones that show up on our radar. Similarly, we don't yet hook
in to all different packages for whitespace trimming to inform
them about editorconfig settings, but aim for better coverage
of things like [ws-trim](ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/ws-trim.el).

## Customize

### `editorconfig-custom-hooks`

A list of custom hooks after loading common EditorConfig settings, where you can
set some custom variables or overwrite existing properties.

For example, `web-mode` has several variables for indentation offset size and
EditorConfig sets them at once by `indent_size`. You may want to stop indenting
only blocks of `web-mode`: it can be achieved by adding following to your init.el:

```emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'editorconfig-custom-hooks
  (lambda (hash) (setq web-mode-block-padding 0)))
```

You can also define your own custom properties and enable them here.

### `editorconfig-indentation-alist`

Alist of indentation setting methods by modes.

For the easiest case to add a new support for a major-mode, you just need to
add a pair of major-mode symbol and its indentation variables:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'editorconfig-indentation-alist
  ;; Just an example, of course EditorConfig has already included this setting!
  '(c-mode c-basic-offset))
```

You can also modify this variable with the command
<kbd>M-x customize-variable [RET] editorconfig-indentation-alist [RET]</kbd>.
For a bit more complicated cases please take a look at the docstring of this variable.

## Testing

Make and [CMake](https://cmake.org) must be installed to run the tests.

To run the tests:

    $ make test
