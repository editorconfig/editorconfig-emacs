;;; Commentary:

;; EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent
;; coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

;; The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining
;; coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable
;; editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
;; EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with
;; version control systems.
